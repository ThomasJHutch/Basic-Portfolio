        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Tom and I will be 25 on November 15, 2019. It's an
          important life changing milestone at 1/4 a century old and the
          beginning of a new decade in 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a Texas A&M graduate with a B.S. in Business management and I have
          been in search of a brighter and more exciting career path for about a
          year now. I Have just started a fantastic job as the SEO and Web
          Content specialist for a major eComerce store while taking this
          program and can't wait to get started coding.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have had an interest in computers and engineering my whole life and
          have been building them for over 10 years now; it's high time i
          learned to code too. I learned HTML in highschool along with
          Photoshop, after effects, premier pro and cinematography, hopefully
          that experience helps with the Bootcamp.
